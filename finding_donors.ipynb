    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes models are most famously used as spam classifiers, which is a good example for the model because the percent of emails that are actually spam is low, which Naive Bayes accounts for as a prior.\n",
    "    - The strength of this model is that it's often fairly accurate but really low cost and fast, unlike a lot of the other classification models. It performs best with categorical variables (like text data) rather than numerical (you have to normalize these), which the majority of the variables in this dataset are.\n",
    "    - The main weakness of this model is its assumption that all of the variables are independent, which is often untrue. \n",
    "    - This dataset has a lot of categorical variables and an uneven split in outcomes, which makes GaussianNB a good candidate to try out. I am slightly nervous that it won't perform well because socioeconomic variables (and therefore most of the features in the model) are often correlated, and this model may suffer because of the independence assumption.\n",

    "    \n",
    "2. Ensemble Methods (tried out all of them, selected Gradient Boosting because it had the best accuracy and F score)\n",
    "     - At my company, we use boosting models to classify listings on our site into product categories.\n",
    "     - The advantage of ensemble models are their predictive power - Gradient Boosting seems to be the most often used model in Kaggle competitions and often had the best performance in labs throughout the first section of the course. It also prevents the overfitting problems and can handle outliers, which are issues that single decision trees often have.\n",
    "     - The problem with ensemble models, and gradient boosting in particular, is the long run time. It's much slower than choosing something simple like naive bayes or logistic regression.\n",
    "     - Gradient boosting is good at handling a large, variable dataset, and also is one of the more accurate classifiers, so it seems like a natural solution for this problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logistic Regression\n",
    "    - Logistic regression can be used for a lot of classification problems, but is especially useful when actual probabilities for each data point could be helpful, since its coefficients can be interpreted easily. At my company, we've been using logistic regression to predict the likelihood of users to return to the site and to make a purchase.\n",
    "    - The strength of logistic regression is that it's easy and fast, and still predicts fairly accurately. As I mentioned before, the outputted probabilities can also be useful.\n",
    "    - The weakness is that it's a linear model, meaning it has high bias and won't work well for data with more complex relationships.\n",
    "    - It feels like a lot of the variables in this dataset will be linearly correlated with income (age and education for example), so it seems like logistic regression would do a good job and be one of the most efficient options here."

    "I am choosing to use a Gradient Boosting model for this assignment. I'm using it because it has both the highest F-score and the highest accuracy score out of any model, while using a reasonable amount of training and prediction time. The model's F-scores for the training and testing set also converge as you increase the sample size, meaning it's likely not over or underfitting and will perform well regardless of the sample you give to it. \n",

    "That it performs well makes a lot of sense. This dataset has a large number of features, both continuous and categorical, which makes a nonlinear model like a Decision Tree do especially well. A boosting model is essentially just a decision tree that improves upon itself, which decreases the overfitting problem that decision trees often have."

    "The gradient boosting model works by starting with a simple prediction for every data point, which is based on the probability that someone makes over 50K in the dataset. So if a majority of people make less than 50K, it'll guess that everyone is under 50K. It calculates how accurate this prediction is. Then, it builds a decision tree, which groups the data by the other variables in order to make predictions about income. It gives the data points it had initially got wrong extra weight when building this new tree, so that the model pays extra attention to the guesses it initially got wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, it repeats the whole process again - it looks at which points the decision tree predicted incorrectly and gives them extra weight, then builds another decision tree on top of that. It keeps building decision trees until its accuracy doesn't improve anymore. Then it uses those same trees to make predictions about other data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is a good method because one decision tree can overfit, meaning that if there are outliers in the data, it will pay too close of attention to them and then make bad predictions later. Adding multiple decision trees together, and calling out outliers in subsequent trees by giving them additional weight, prevents this from happening.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
