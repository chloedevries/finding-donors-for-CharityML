# finding-donors-for-CharityML
Create supervised machine learning model to identify potential donors for charity

## Overview
This is the first project for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning course. The purpose is to understand the basics of several different supervised learning models, learn how to select a model for a specific problem, and train, tune, and then evaluate it.

The premise of this project involved a fake nonprofit called CharityML, for whom we needed to build a classification model to identify people who would donate. The data used is from the US Census.

## Installation
This project uses the following python libraries:
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
* matplotlib

Jupyter notebook is also required.
